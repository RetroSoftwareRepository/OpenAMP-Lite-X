OpenAMP Lite X is an open source continuation of the forgotten MacAMP Lite X by Subband Technologies.

##### Backstory
MacAMP was originally an app for the Classic MacOS. Being that it predates WinAMP by a few months, it is the oldest MP3 player ever made. The app was created while the developers were still a part of Nullsoft, and in 1999 Subband Technologies was born after AOL bought Nullsoft. In 2002, the Mac OS X version of Lite was released. By early 2008, Subband Technologies and by extension the killer app of an MP3 player both disappeared, never to be seen again.

##### Compiling
To compile it, you need Xcode 1.0 or newer installed for the command line tools and interface builder

`gcc *.c -o OpenAMP`
